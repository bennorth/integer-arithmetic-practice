# Simple app to practise signed integer arithmetic

**[Try the game here.](https://bennorth.github.io/integer-arithmetic-practice/)**

I thought a student I work with would find it useful to improve their
fluency at addition, subtraction and multiplication of small signed
integers.  I also thought that there would be many websites doing this
job.  But after a non-trivial (but non-exhaustive) search, I didn't
find anything which did quite what I wanted.  There were games which
would do addition and subtraction, and games which would do
multiplication, but I didn't come across one which mixed the
operations.  And a lot of them were dressed up in games which often
looked good, but were quite heavyweight.

I also wanted to experiment with replit's AI-driven agent, so used
this as a test case, describing what I wanted, and iterating via to
and fro with the agent.  I was reasonably impressed with what it
managed, although it claimed to fix a bug when in fact it hadn't, and
I ran out of free credits pretty early in the development process.  So
I continued working on it manually.  I like the way replit gives you a
Git history of the agent's work, which I've preserved in this repo as
the early commits.
